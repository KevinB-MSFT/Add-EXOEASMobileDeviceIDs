This script will add mobile device IDs to user's mailbox from a source CSV file by running the Set-CasMailbox -ActiveSyncAllowedDeviceIDs Exchange Online PowerShell command.  The source file is best generated by running this script, https://github.com/garrint/EXO-Mobile-Device-Inventory, to gather all of the device IDs but can be be manually populated.

NOTE: The 3.6 script is dependent on having the EXOv2 module installed (https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement). If you dont have the EXOv2 module installed yet, the 2.5.1(EXOv1-module) script will use the v1 ADAL module instead, but version 2.5 still requests with resultsize unlmited (which may not complete in large env).

The script will do the following:
1. Import the source CSV
2. Sort and hash the source CSV in order to make as few calls to Exchange Online as possible
3. Loop through all of the users found in the source CSV and add the device IDs

The script is also coded for large environments by having logic to check and maintain the health of the Exchange Online PowerShell session.
